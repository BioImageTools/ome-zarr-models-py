# ome-zarr-models-py

This is a Python package that provides a Python object representation of an OME-zarr dataset.
It is designed with the following guiding principles:

- Slim, with as few dependencies as possible
- Strict adherence to the OME-zarr specification
- A separate object for each version of the OME-zarr specification
- Data operations are out of scope

This aims to be a reference implementation of the OME-zarr specification.
