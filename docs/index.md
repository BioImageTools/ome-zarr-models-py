# ome-zarr-models-py

This is a Python package that provides a Python object representation of an OME-zarr dataset.
It aims to be a reference implementation of the OME-zarr specification.

## Design

This package is designed with the following guiding principles:

- Strict adherence to the OME-zarr specification
- A usable set of Python classes for reading and writing and interacting with OME-zarr metadata
- A separate object for each version of the OME-zarr specification
- Data operations are out of scope

We are trying to make this as usable and useful as possible while still complying with the OME-zarr specification.
